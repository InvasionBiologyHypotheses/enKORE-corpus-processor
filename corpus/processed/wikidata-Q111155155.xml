  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;The presence and diversity of marine non-native species, the number of new invasions, and the impact on native communities and habitats are important metrics used to assess the health of marine ecosystems. Monitoring for marine non-native species, using traditional approaches such as rapid assessment surveys (RASs), requires taxonomic expertise and may still fail to detect rare or inconspicuous species. This study reports a validation process for a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay based on the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, designed to detect highly invasive tunicate &lt;jats:italic&gt;Didemnum vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; by targeting environmental DNA (eDNA) present in water samples. The &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; qPCR assay showed high sensitivity, with the threshold limit of detection (LOD) and modeled LOD3 (based on triplicate qPCR reactions) estimated as 9.187 and 1.117 copies reaction&lt;jats:sup&gt;–1&lt;/jats:sup&gt;, respectively and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was calculated as 18 copies reaction&lt;jats:sup&gt;–1&lt;/jats:sup&gt;. Analyses of water samples collected from selected Pacific oyster farms and recreational marinas in Scotland showed 100% concordance between the historical data on presence of &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; from RASs and detection of &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; eDNA. Consistency of detection of &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; eDNA among different sampling points within each infected sampling site varied, ranging between 100% positive throughout the site to some sampling points testing “negative” or only as “suspected” for &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt;. Sites with lower within-site detection consistency included sites with a low density of &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; as reported by RASs or were sites undergoing &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; management. The present pilot monitoring program demonstrates the potential to generate important data on presence of &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt;. This program will be scaled up across large geographic regions and used in the first instance to focus and target the traditional RASs to &lt;jats:italic&gt;D. vexillum&lt;/jats:italic&gt; eDNA-positive sites in a cost-effective way, with an aim to verify the species presence by visual observation and direct Sanger sequencing of positive qPCR products.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
