  <dc:description>Knowledge on reproductive traits of problematic invasive alien plants, such as the woody invasive shrub Pyracantha angustifolia of temperate Chinese origin, can help better manage invasive species. To determine factors contributing to its invasion, we investigated floral visitors and pollen loads, self-compatibility, seed set, seed rain, soil seed banks, and seed longevity in the soil. Generalist insects were recorded visiting flowers and all carried pollen loads of high purity (&gt;70%). Floral visitor exclusion experiments showed that P. angustifolia can set seed (66%) without pollen vectors, although natural pollination resulted in higher fruit set (91%). Fruit count surveys and seed set showed an exponentially increased relationship between seed set and plant size with high natural seed yield (±2 million seeds m−2). Soil core samples revealed a high seed density of 46,400 ± (SE) 8934 m−2 under shrubs, decreasing with distance away from the shrub. Bowl traps stationed under trees and fences confirmed that seeds were efficiently dispersed by animals. Buried seeds survived for less than six months in the soil. Due to high seed production, self-compatibility augmented by generalist pollen vectors, and effective seed dispersal by local frugivores, it is difficult to manage the spread manually. Management of this species should focus on the short life span of seeds.</dc:description>
