  <dc:description>&lt;h4&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;Little is known about cryptosporidiosis in turtles of invasive alien species (IAS) inhabiting European bodies of fresh water. In this article, we report an occurrence of Cryptosporidium parvum in a red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) captured in a rural aquatic ecosystem in eastern Poland.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A pair of samples consisting of feces and scrapings of intestinal mucosa (taken during necropsy) were collected from 104 animals representing the four IAS turtle species red-eared slider, yellow-bellied slider, false map and Cumberland slider. The animals were trapped in running and standing freshwater ecosystems across the Lublin province. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from samples using a modified alkali wash and a heat-lysis method and identification of the Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18SSU rRNA and COWP loci.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The presence of Cryptosporidium DNA was only detected in one sample of intestinal scraping collected from a red-eared slider. A phylogenetic analysis of a 18SSU rRNA gene fragment showed 100% sequence identity between the C. parvum strain isolated from the turtle and other C. parvum strains previously detected in cattle from the Lublin province.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;There was no clinical evidence that the red-eared slider turtle was truly infected rather than being merely a mechanical parasite carrier. Sporadic detection of this protozoan parasite in the studied population of IAS turtles could be associated with low natural occurrence of Cryptosporidium infections in this animal species. The results provide evidence for possible transmission of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species by IAS turtles.</dc:description>
