  <dc:description>Biological invasions in forest ecosystems are recognised as a global scale challenge. However, our current knowledge of invasive alien forest insect species (IAFIS) in Romania is still lacking and rather insufficient to support clear policies. The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of IAFIS in the Muntenia and Dobrogea provinces of Romania. For this purpose, direct observations and insect collections were made two consecutive years, in 76 locations. Of these, 67 sampling locations forming a long field observation route were visited only once, and nine sampling locations were fixed monitoring points with primed traps used in first year for regular collection of insects at 1-2-week intervals. Seventeen non-native forest insect species from five orders and 11 families were detected: Aproceros leucopoda, Cameraria ohridella, Corythucha arcuata, Cydalima perspectalis, Dasineura gleditchiae, Eopineus strobus, Euura tibialis, Gilletteella cooleyi, Hyphantria cunea, Ips duplicatus, Macrosaccus robiniella, Neoclytus acuminatus, Obolodiplosis robiniae, Parectopa robiniella, Phyllonorycter issikii, Prociphilus fraxinifolii and Xylosandrus germanus. _Eleven IAFIS species originate from North America, four from Asia and two from Europe. All detected species were previously reported from Romania, but eight species had not been recorded in these two provinces. Seven species live on native tree species, while 10 thrive on exotic trees or shrubs. The highest number of IAFIS was recorded in urban areas. Except for E. tibialis, all found IAFIS have a significant ecological or economic impact across invaded habitats. The risks posed by biological invasions need more thorough consideration that deserves greater attention and scientific support.</dc:description>
