  <dc:description>Invasion of western North America by the annual exotic grassBromus tectorumL. (cheatgrass) has been an ecological disaster. High soil bioavailability of nitrogen is a contributing factor in the invasive potential ofB. tectorum. Application of labile carbon sources to the soil can immobilize soil nitrogen and favor native species. We studied the interaction of labile carbon addition (sucrose), with soil invasion status and fertilizer addition on the growth ofB. tectorum. Soils were noninvaded (BNI) andB. tectoruminvaded (BI). Treatments were control, sucrose, combined fertilizer, and sucrose + fertilizer. The greenhouse experiment continued for 3 growth-cycles. After the 1st growth-cycle, sucrose addition reducedB. tectorumaboveground mass almost 70 times for the BI soil but did not significantly reduce growth in the BNI soil.B. tectorumaboveground mass, after the 1st growth-cycle, was over 27 times greater for BI control soils than BNI control soils. Although sucrose addition reduced soil-solution , tissue N was not significantly lowered, suggesting that reduction of soil available N may not be solely responsible for reduction inB. tectorumgrowth. Noninvaded soil inhibits growth ofB. tectorum. Understanding this mechanism may lead to viable control strategies.</dc:description>
