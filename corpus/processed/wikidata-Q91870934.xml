  <dc:description>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful tool for monitoring the distribution of aquatic macro-organisms. However, environmental factors, including the water temperature and water quality, can affect the inhibition and/or degradation of eDNA, which complicates accurate estimations of eDNA concentrations and the detection of the presence/absence of species in natural habitats. Further very few eDNA studies have been conducted for reptiles, especially with respect to estimating their biomass and/or abundances. Here we examined the relationship between the visually-observed number of red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and eDNA concentrations across 100 ponds. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of water quality on red-eared slider eDNA concentration in these ponds. We found that there was a significant positive correlation between the observed number of red-eared sliders and the eDNA concentration in the ponds. On comparing various water quality indicators, including dissolved nitrogen, dissolved phosphorous, organic matter, and chlorophyll a (Chl. a), we found that only Chl. a had a negative correlation with the red-eared slider eDNA concentration, while we did not find any inhibition in the quantitative PCR. We conclude that concentrations of eDNA can potentially be used for estimating the abundance of the red-eared slider. Additionally, Chl. a might indirectly influence the degradation of eDNA through the microorganisms bonded to the phytoplankton in the ponds, as microbial activity is thought to decrease eDNA persistence.</dc:description>
