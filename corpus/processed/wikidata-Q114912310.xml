  <dc:description>The frequency and abundance of invasive alien woody plants were recorded along roadsides and at watercourse crossings in 31% (90/286) of the quarter degree squares in the study area. The survey yielded 23 species of which the most prominent invaders were Prosopis spp. The most prominent remaining species were: Opuntia ficus-indica, Nicotiana glauca and Melia azedarach. The greatest abundance and diversity of alien invader plants were recorded near human settlements. More than half of the total recorded species have invaded perennial riverbanks. The episodic Molopo and Kuruman Rivers have been invaded almost exclusively by_ Prosopis spp., which in places have formed extensive stands.</dc:description>
