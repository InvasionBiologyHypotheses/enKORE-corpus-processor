  <dc:description>Natural habitats increasingly face the introduction and spread of non-native species. Under the right conditions, non-native species can become invasive over time. This issue is now being addressed by many experts and researchers who are using and developing various approaches and methods to limit and eliminate or suppress problematic plant species. Many invasive plants are already spreading uncontrollably in urban and forestry areas, causing health hazards, environmental and economic damage and negatively impacting natural ecosystems. The use of chemical agents is generally limited, so our only option to control and suppress the problematic species is mechanical removal. In this research suppression by tree stem wounding, i.e., incomplete girdling, was used. This type of injury causes the plant to lose its vitality, become weaker after first year and then die within a few years. Using a research approach, we chronologically monitored the response of cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) stem tissue to mechanical wounding of the incomplete girdling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light microscopy were used for monitoring moisture content and anatomical changes in different periods after injury. The results of the study showed that cherry laurel, with an intense wound tissue response and other changes, is a species with good compartmentalization potential. The rapid and intense tissue response to injury requires high energy and nutrient consumption and consequently leads to a loss of vigour and mechanical stability, which may result in plant destruction. Results revealed that mechanical wounding by incomplete girdling is a successful method for suppression of non-native and invasive cherry laurel.</dc:description>
