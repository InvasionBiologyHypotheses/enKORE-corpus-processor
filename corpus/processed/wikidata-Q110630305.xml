  <dc:description>Aster lanceolatus Willd. is a herbaceous perennial that is considered
   invasive in many European countries. In Serbia, this plant inhabits wet
   habitats and forms widespread monospecific stands. The objective of this
   research is to determine whether generative reproduction has an important
   role in the expansion of this species to new areas. In 13 different
   localities, fruit heads were collected from lateral and terminal parts of
   infructescence. Seed quantity and germination parameters were determined for
   seeds in the fruit heads. The results showed that the position of the fruit
   heads did not have a major impact on germination parameters. However,
   germination parameters differed among the localities. The findings of this
   study suggest that A. lanceolatus produces a great amount of viable seeds
   that germinate in an amount sufficient to ensure a successful spread of this
   invasive species to new areas.</dc:description>
