  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;The asterinid seastars &lt;jats:italic&gt;Parvulastraparvivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt; and &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.vivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt; share atypical viviparous reproductive modes that have made them of interest for research on life-history evolution and population genetics. This article briefly reviews life-history traits of these endemic Australian species and information on distribution and rarity, as well as providing some additional new analysis. Almost exclusive self-fertilisation has led to extreme genetic poverty in both species and viviparity limits dispersal potential causing relatively small geographical ranges. There is some evidence that the number of intertidal boulder-fields harbouring &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.parvivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, and the overall geographical range, may have become reduced in recent years. In addition, approximately 25 % of boulder-fields with &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.parvivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt; have been colonised by invasive oysters (&lt;jats:italic&gt;Magallanagigas&lt;/jats:italic&gt;). To understand potential effects of oysters on &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.parvivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, we tested for correlations between &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.parvivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt; abundances and cover of oyster encrustations that included this invader (native + non-native oyster shells were assessed together because they produced similar encrustations and largely could not be differentiated). Linear regression showed no evidence, however, for any correlation. For &lt;jats:italic&gt;P.vivipara&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, population survey data from the mid 1970â€™s to present shows marked decline in areas of previous abundance. Parallel with this decline, the boulder habitat has experienced infill and siltation and cementing of the substratum by &lt;jats:italic&gt;M.gigas&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, sponges and other encrusters as well as anoxia. Important future research outcomes on consequences of atypical life-history traits may be allowed by continued research on these seastars but only if their populations are able to persist within the small number of boulder-fields where they occur. Current trends may indicate a need for conservation intervention.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
