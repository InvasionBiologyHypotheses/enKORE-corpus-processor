  <dc:description>Abstract
              The Asian cyprinid Pseudorasbora parva is considered to be a major threat to native fish communities and listed as an invasive alien species of European Union concern. Our study aims to gain evidence-based knowledge on the impact of both P. parva and its parasite Sphaerothecum destruens on native fish populations by analysing fish assemblages and body condition of individuals of native fish species in floodplain water bodies that were invaded and uninvaded by P. parva. We explored the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques to detect S. destruens. Prevalence of S. destruens in native fish species was assessed. Fish samplings showed significantly negative correlations between the abundance of P. parva and the native Leucaspius delineatus, and Pungitius pungitius and three biodiversity indices of the fish assemblages (Simpson’s diversity index, Shannon–Wiener index and evenness). Contrastingly, the abundances of the native Gasterosteus aculeatus and P. parva were positively related. In nearly all isolated water bodies with P. parva, this species is outnumbering native fish species. No effect of P. parva presence was found on body condition of native fish species. Sphaerothecum destruens was demonstrated to occur in both P. parva and G. aculeatus. Gasterosteus aculeatus is suggested to be an asymptomatic carrier that can aid the further spread of S. destruens. Analysis of eDNA proved to be a promising method for early detection of S. destruens, here showing that S. destruens presence coincided with P. parva presence. The ongoing invasion of both P. parva and S. destruens is predicted to pose a significant risk to native fish communities.
