  <dc:description>The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the invasive European fire ant (Myrmica rubra) are both expanding throughout their sympatric range in coastal New England.Ixodes scapularisis the primary vector of the bacteriumBorrelia burgdorferi, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, and Mount Desert Island, Maine, home to Acadia National Park, currently is affected by a high Lyme disease burden. Ticks have many natural predators, including ants, although no previous studies have investigated interactions between these two species. To test the hypothesis that the presence ofM.rubraaltersI.scapularisabundance, we collected ticks by drag-sampling at eight ant-infested sites and eight uninfested control sites in Acadia National Park. We found that nymph density was significantly higher at ant-infested sites, while larval density was significantly higher at control sites. In addition, we conducted a laboratory bioassay to measureM.rubraaggression againstI.scapularislarvae, nymphs, and adults andDermacentor variabilisadults, and found that ant aggression was significantly higher againstD.variabilisadults thanI.scapularisadults. Our findings support the hypothesis thatM.rubrahas divergent effects acrossI.scapularislife stages, and we discuss possible ecological mechanisms, including optimal microclimate and predation, that could promote density of nymphs while inhibiting density of larvae.</dc:description>
