  <dc:description>Leukocyte activation within the chorioamniotic membranes is strongly associated with inflammation and preterm labor (PTL). We hypothesized that prophylaxis with a broad-spectrum chemokine inhibitor (BSCI) would downregulate the inflammatory microenvironment induced by Group B Streptococcus (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) to suppress PTL and microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC). To correlate BSCI administration with PTL and MIAC, we used a unique chronically catheterized non-human primate model of Group B Streptococcus (GBS)-induced PTL. In the early third trimester (128-138 days gestation; ~29-32 weeks human pregnancy), animals received choriodecidual inoculations of either: (1) saline (N = 6), (2) GBS, 1-5 × 108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml; N = 5), or (3) pre-treatment and daily infusions of a BSCI (10 mg/kg intravenous and intra-amniotic) with GBS (1-5 × 108 CFU/ml; N = 4). We measured amniotic cavity pressure (uterine contraction strength) and sampled amniotic fluid (AF) and maternal blood serially and cord blood at delivery. Cesarean section was performed 3 days post-inoculation or earlier for PTL. Data analysis used Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Saline inoculation did not induce PTL or infectious sequelae. In contrast, GBS inoculation typically induced PTL (4/5, 80%), MIAC and fetal bacteremia (3/5; 60%). Remarkably, PTL did not occur in the BSCI+GBS group (0/4, 0%; p = 0.02 vs. GBS), despite MIAC and fetal bacteremia in all cases (4/4; 100%). Compared to the GBS group, BSCI prophylaxis was associated with significantly lower cytokine levels including lower IL-8 in amniotic fluid (p = 0.03), TNF- in fetal plasma (p p = 0.02) and IL-18, IL-2, and IL-7 in the fetal brain (p = 0.03). Neutrophilic chorioamnionitis was common in the BSCI and GBS groups, but was more severe in the BSCI+GBS group with greater myeloperoxidase staining (granulocyte marker) in the amnion and chorion (p </dc:description>
