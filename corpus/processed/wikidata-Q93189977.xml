  <dc:description>Aedes koreicus is a mosquito species native to Asia that has recently successfully invaded new areas in several European countries. Here, we provide important data on Ae. koreicus establishment in Pécs (Southern Hungary). Mosquito surveillance was carried out weekly between 2016 and 2019 at 10 different sites located throughout the city from May to September. We conducted a statistical analysis to evaluate the most important abiotic factors driving Ae. koreicus abundance. We then calibrated a previously developed temperature-dependent mathematical model to the recorded captures to evaluate mosquito abundance in the study area. We found that too high summer temperatures negatively affect mosquito abundance. The model accurately replicated the observed capture patterns, providing an estimate of Ae. koreicus density for each breeding season, which we interpolated to map Ae. koreicus abundance throughout Pécs. We found a negative correlation between mosquito captures and human density, suggesting that Ae. koreicus does not necessarily require humans for its blood meals. Our study provides a successful application of a previously published mathematical model to investigate Ae. koreicus population dynamics, proving its suitability for future studies, also within an epidemiological framework.</dc:description>
