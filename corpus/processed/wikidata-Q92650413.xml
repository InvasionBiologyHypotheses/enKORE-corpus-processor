  <dc:description>In most bacteria, iron plays a vital role in pathogenesis processes. To support survival and infection, &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; has evolved three ABC transporters, PiaABC, PiuABC, and PitABC. Moreover, indirect evidence supports that operon 804 may be a novel ABC transporter in &lt;i&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. We have recently described the identification of lipoprotein SPD_1609 in operon 804; however, whether the SPD_1609 protein affects the virulence of &lt;i&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; has not yet been studied. In the present work, alignment analysis showed that lipoprotein SPD_1609 is conserved in a variety of gram-positive bacteria, and deletion of the &lt;i&gt;spd_1609&lt;/i&gt; gene led to a reduction in adherence and invasion of &lt;i&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; to host cells. RT-qPCR assays indicated that deletion of the &lt;i&gt;spd_1609&lt;/i&gt; gene resulted in decreased expression of genes involved in colonization. Furthermore, decreased virulence in a mouse bacteremia infection model caused by the loss of the lipoprotein encoded by &lt;i&gt;spd_1609&lt;/i&gt; was also demonstrated. Overall, these data provide insights into the functional role of lipoprotein SPD_1609 in pneumococcal pathogenesis, suggesting its possibility to be developed as a novel &lt;i&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; vaccine candidate.</dc:description>
