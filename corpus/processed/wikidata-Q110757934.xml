  <dc:description>Background:During 2005-13, at Osoyoos Lake, British Columbia, we investigated trophic relationships among fry ofOncorhynchus nerkaWalbaum (Sockeye and kokanee), a suite of limnetic planktivores includingMysis diluviana, and their zooplankton prey.Objectives:Our goal was to quantify the impacts that a recently introduced population ofMysiswould have on density, growth and survival of resident age-0 Sockeye Salmon.Methods:Evidence ofMysisimpact was based on (a) simple correlation analysis between various biophysical performance measures and (b) production and bioenergetics models used to identify the strength of bottom-up (i.e. production-driven) and top-down (i.e.consumption-driven) processes.Results:This nine-year study indicated that the Osoyoos Lake food web was strongly influenced by external events These included: large annual variations in river discharge, an earthen dam failure and effluent input from an Okanagan River tributary, and highly variable recruitment ofO. nerkafry given out-of-basin factors (harvest, marine survival) controlling adult salmon returns. Surprisingly, large annual variations inO. nerkarecruitment (0.63 - 7.0 million fry), did not induce significant top-down associations in growth, survival or subsequent production among the macro-planktivores (pelagic fish andMysis) and their zooplankton prey. A single significant correlation (p  0.05) betweenO. nerkafry abundance and their von BertalanffyWparameter emerged from a set of 14 potential top-down associations tested. By contrast, we identified several strongly positive bottom-up effects in which survival ofO. nerkafry was significantly associated (p  0.01) with annual variations in total zooplankton biomass,Daphniabiomass andEpischurabiomass. Our results indicate thatMysisplayed a dual role in the Osoyoos Lake pelagic food web. As predators, they accounted for an average (June-October) of 64% of the total prey biomass consumed by fish andMysis. As prey,Mysiscontributed an average of 35% of the prey biomass consumed by fish. Consumption by fish andMysistogether accounted for daily losses of only 4.5% of non-mysid zooplankton biomass and 34% of daily zooplankton production.Conclusion:We conclude that in all years, combined prey consumption byMysisand fish was never high enough, acting alone, to reduce the availability of their potential zooplankton forage base. However, we also estimate that in the absence ofMysis,O. nerkafry could experience a 43% increase in their daily food intake and that fish andMysismight control their principal prey taxa when exogenous factors (e.g.annual discharge) induced major reductions in zooplankton biomass. Finally, althoughMysishas clearly altered the energy flow pathways from plankton to fish in the Osoyoos Lake food-web, mysids have not precluded rebuildingO. nerkaabundance to levels at or exceeding historic maxima.</dc:description>
