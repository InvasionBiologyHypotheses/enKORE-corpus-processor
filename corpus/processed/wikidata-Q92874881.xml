  <dc:description>The pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes has been evolving into a few phylogenetic lineages. Phylogenetically defined substitutions were described in the L. monocytogenes virulence factor InlB, which mediates active invasion into mammalian cells via interactions with surface receptors c-Met and gC1q-R. InlB internalin domain (idInlB) is central to interactions with c-Met. Here we compared activity of purified recombinant idInlB isoforms characteristic for L. monocytogenes phylogenetic lineage I and II. Size exclusion chromatography and intrinsic fluorescence were used to characterize idInlBs. Western blotting was used to study activation of c-Met-dependent MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-pathways. Solid-phase microplate binding and competition assay was used to quantify interactions with gCq1-R. Isogenic recombinant L. monocytogenes strains were used to elucidate the input of idInlB isoforms in HEp-2 cell invasion. Physicochemical parameters of idInlB isoforms were similar but not identical. Kinetics of Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in response to purified idInlBs was lineage specific. Lineage I but not lineage II idInlB specifically bound gC1q-R. Antibody against gC1q-R amino acids 221â€“249 inhibited invasion of L. monocytogenes carrying lineage I but not lineage II idInlB. Taken together, obtained results suggested that phylogenetically defined substitutions in idInlB provide functional distinctions and might be involved in phylogenetically determined differences in virulence potential.</dc:description>
