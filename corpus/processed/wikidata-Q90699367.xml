  <dc:description>A recent analysis by Moulton &amp; Cropper (2019) of a global dataset on alien bird population introductions claims to find no evidence that establishment success is a function of the size of the founding population. Here, we re-analyse Moulton &amp; Cropper’s data and show that this conclusion is based on flawed statistical methods—their data in fact confirm a strong positive relationship between founding population size and establishment success. We also refute several non-statistical arguments against the likelihood of such an effect presented by Moulton &amp; Cropper. We conclude that a core tenet of population biology—that small populations are more prone to extinction—applies to alien populations beyond their native geographic range limits as much as to native populations within them.</dc:description>
