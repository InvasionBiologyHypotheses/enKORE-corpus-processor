  <dc:description>Birds have long been hypothesized as primary dispersal agents of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand). Although A. tsugae eggs and mobile first instars (crawlers) have been collected from wild birds, key mechanistic elements necessary for avian dispersal have never been examined. To evaluate the mechanisms of bird-mediated A. tsugae dispersal, we conducted both stationary (i.e., where crawlers must actively disperse) and disturbance (i.e., where crawlers may transfer from substrates due to mechanical abrasion) dispersal trials. For stationary trials, we tested the role of perching duration, ovisac density, and seasonal timing on the rate of crawler transfer to immobile preserved bird mounts at a single site in Connecticut. For disturbance trials, we explored if transfer rates were different when branches were actively brushed against birds. Both stationary and disturbance trials resulted in successful transfers of A. tsugae to bird mounts, with disturbance trials having significantly higher rates of transfers. Crawler counts from stationary trials increased significantly with local ovisac density. Additionally, we found a nonlinear relationship between crawler transfer and experimental week, with crawler transfer highest at the beginning of sampling in May, coinciding with avian spring migration in Connecticut and the emergence of progrediens crawlers, and spiking again near 14 June, when sistens generation crawlers began to emerge. While many aspects of potential avian dispersal of A. tsugae remain unknown, these results suggest that crawler transfer to birds may occur most often when peak crawler emergence coincides with the northward migration of many small passerine bird species.</dc:description>
