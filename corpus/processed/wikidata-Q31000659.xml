  <dc:description>Invasive, non-native species represent a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. The African amphibian Xenopus laevis is widely regarded as an invasive species and a threat to local faunas. Populations originating at the Western Cape, South Africa, have been introduced on four continents, mostly in areas with a similar Mediterranean climate. Some introduced populations are also established in cooler environments where persistence for many decades suggests a capacity for long-term adaptation. In these cases, recent climate warming might enhance invasion ability, favouring range expansion, population growth and negative effects on native faunas. In the cool temperate UK, populations have been established for about 50_years in Wales and for an unknown period, probably &gt;20_years, in England (Lincolnshire). Our field studies over 30 and 10_years, respectively, show that in favourable conditions there may be good recruitment, fast individual growth rates and large body size; maximum longevity exceeds 23_years. Nevertheless, areas of distribution remained limited, with numbers X. laevis in these areas indicates that even relatively long-established alien species remain vulnerable to rare extreme weather conditions.</dc:description>
