  <dc:description>Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) commonly known as fall armyworm (FAW),_is a pest that invaded the sub-tropical and tropical regions of America. In 2016, it was reported for the first time in central Africa and within a year it was reported from many countries of Africa. It then spread in Asia and in 2018 it was reported in India, and now its infestation was seen in Pakistan. Its strong flight, climatic adaptableness and large host range makes it a good colonizing agent as compared to other species of Spodoptera. In potential managing strategies we must know about its primary information such as its biology, host range, habitat and favorable conditions. Identification and life cycle is the most important process in the management of this pest. IPM strategies include physical and cultural control, botanical control, biological control and chemical control. These strategies will help in management of FAW. All these aspects have been reviewed in this article.</dc:description>
