  <dc:description>Invasive alien species (IAS) are a significant component of global changes, causing severe economic and biodiversity damage. In this regard,Hakea sericeais one of the most widespread IAS throughout the Mediterranean region, including Portugal. The difficulty surrounding its management is exacerbated by post-fire situations, signifying a challenging task for managers. To assist in this effort, we used a system dynamic approach to model the population dynamics ofHakea sericearegarding the combinations of wildfire risk and control scenarios, which differ in periodicity, type of interventions, and cohort age. The ultimate goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness and costs of control efforts at reducing the abundance of this IAS. A Natura 2000 site Alvão/Marão (code PTCON0003) in northern Portugal, severely invaded byHakea sericea, served as the study site. The modeling results demonstrate thatHakea sericeais likely to continue spreading if left uncontrolled. Although it may not be possible to ensure eradication ofHakea sericeafrom the study, repeated control actions aimed at the entire IAS population could be very effective in reducing its area. From a practical standpoint, removing all plants 24 months after each fire event followed by subsequent monitoring appears to be the most cost-effective strategy for managingHakea sericea. Considering the modeling results, the dynamic modeling framework developed is a versatile, instructive tool that can support decision-making aimed at effective management ofHakea sericea.</dc:description>
