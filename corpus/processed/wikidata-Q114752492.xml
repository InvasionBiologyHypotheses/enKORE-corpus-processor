  <dc:description>Despite its importance for biological control of heteropteran pests (Hemiptera) and remarkable features, the taxonomy of the genus Trichopoda remained confusing for a long time. Due to a recent taxonomic revision, new information about its species real distribution and host records were found out. An invasive species of the genus has been recorded for Europe for decades, but it has been misidentified as Trichopoda (Galactomyia) pennipes for a long time. Here we present the correct name for that alien species, Trichopoda (Galactomyia) pictipennis. Some comments about the identification of Trichopoda species introduced in other areas, such as Australia, are also made. The correct species identification, as well as the correct host records, is crucial for future studies regarding biological control, and to under-stand the possible impacts that this invasive species could cause to the local environment.</dc:description>
