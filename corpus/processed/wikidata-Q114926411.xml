  <dc:description>Abstract
International trade is a significant factor in the introduction of invasive alien species around the world. The preparedness of countries through their domestic regulations to combat invasive alien species differs from country to country. This article discusses the potential of WTO law in combating the spread of invasive alien species in countries with weak environmental regulation regimes such as Botswana. It recognises the possibility of invoking provisions of WTO agreements by member states to combat the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. It concludes that the use of WTO agreements by developing countries may be an immediate solution to address and combat biodiversity losses in the global south. The article recommends the building of technical and scientific capacity by developing countries to effectively use international trade law for environmental protection.</dc:description>
