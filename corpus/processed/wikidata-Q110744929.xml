  <dc:description>Abstract
               Balance benefit of ecological, economic, and social is a part of sustainable forest management. Industrial forest plantation is one of the ecological practices through increasing land cover to provide a good impact for economic and social. Introducing suitable species for industry from out of regions is commonly practiced in the plantation. In Indonesia, some Acacias species have been recognized as major plantation species to meet industrial requirements that are economically feasible, suited to major end-product, high productivity, and fast growth. However, some studies have classified the Acacias as exotic species which potentially show an invasive. Taking into account such invasiveness and anticipating ecological risk, this paper presents some considerations on plantation management and biological practices of the Acacias. Compromises among the reproductive system, growth, and rotation in the plantation management could limit the invasiveness. Besides high stand productivity, results from genetic and breeding could also provide a positive impact to diminish the reproductive process of trees that consequently reduce seeds in the Acacias plantation and limit its invasiveness. It concludes that some considerations and a good understanding of biological factors in plantation management practices could reduce ecological risk from the invasiveness of Acacias, and even it could be used for increasing plantation productivity.</dc:description>
