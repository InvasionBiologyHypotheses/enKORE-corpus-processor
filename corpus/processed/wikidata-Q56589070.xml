The control of invasive species is a major challenge to the preservation of native ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. A population of the invasive common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was detected in Lakes Sorell and Crescent, Tasmania, Australia, in the mid-1990s. Early detection allowed for the containment of their population to this lacustrine system. Radio-telemetry was subsequently used over a 5-year period to understand seasonal distribution of carp in relation to environmental parameters to guide efficient eradication strategies. The present study found that fish displayed increased mobility during spring–summer periods, moving into shallow habitat rich in macrophytes, particularly during years of high lake levels. During years of low lake levels, this pattern was altered with frequent use of a rocky ‘secondary’ habitat in Lake Sorell. During winter, carp congregated in deeper habitat in Lake Sorell, whereas no habitat-specific winter aggregations were found in Lake Crescent. The increased knowledge of spatio-temporal preferences of carp provided a basis for deploying barriers to facilitate the capture of fish and sabotage spawning events. The results have led to the eradication of carp from Lake Crescent and a significant reduction of their population in Lake Sorell.
