  <dc:description>The frequency and abundance of invasive alien woody plants were recorded along roadsides and at watercourse crossings in 87% (152/175) of the quarter degree squares in the study area. The survey yielded BO species of which the most prominent species (in order of prominence) in roadside and veld habitats were:_ Chromolaena odoruta, Solatium mauritianum, Psidium guajava, Rubus spp., Acacia meamsu and Lantana camara The most prominent species (in order of prominence) in streambank habitats were:_ Acacia dealbata, A. meamsii and_ Salix babylonica.The greatest intensity of invasion was recorded in the Natal midlands and in the coastal belt of southern Natal, including the metropolitan areas of Pietermaritzburg and Durban. There was relatively little invasion in the north-eastern lowlands of Natal but the potential for expansion is great. Little invasion was recorded in the north-eastern Orange Free State except along some watercourses.</dc:description>
