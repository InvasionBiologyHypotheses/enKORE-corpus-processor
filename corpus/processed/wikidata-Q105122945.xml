  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt; The factors controlling the effects of introduced trout on native galaxiid fishes in New Zealand streams were investigated by quantitative and qualitative electrofishing. Habitat assessments indicated that bed stability was closely related to total fish biomass. Exotic trout were not present at the most unstable sites but inhabited most medium to large streams with stable beds. Galaxiids (Galaxias vulgaris, Galaxias brevipinnis, and Galaxias paucispondylus) occurred at sites that spanned almost the entire range of habitat conditions and co-occurred with trout more frequently at intermediate levels of bed stability. However, galaxiids were absent from all sites with large (&gt;150-mm fork length (FL)) brown (Salmo trutta) and rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout. These streams tended to be larger, with more stable beds. In a field tank experiment, large brown trout consumed Canterbury galaxias (G. vulgaris), ranging in size from 48- to 94-mm FL, at a much higher rate than did small trout. Their predation of galaxiids appeared not to be size selective, so there was no size refuge for galaxiids from predation by large trout. These results indicate that predation by large trout has likely eliminated small-bodied galaxiids from many streams but that trout impact is limited by the availability of habitats suitable for large individuals. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
