  <dc:description>Biological systems are subject to a dramatic increase in invading species in the 21st century due to increasing globalization around the world. In the near future, these species will cause more extensive ecological as well as socio-economic damage. Biotic invasions will result not only in a reduction of the original biodiversity, but also total loss, particularly degradation of natural habitats – especially Natura 2000 habitats. This study aims to understand the processes of spread of invasive plant species, their way of life, adaptation to environmental changes and displacement of native species. Without the local level, it is not possible to understand these processes on the regional and continental dimensions and thus implement scientific facts and findings into the prediction of the development of global biosystems. The_research was conducted during the vegetation period in the years 2017–2021 in the studied areas of non-forest and forest habitats in the central part of Slovakia. We recorded 242 localities in the area with the occurrence of invasive plant species in an area of 3.057 km2 out of the total mapped area of 169.024 km2. We recorded the highest number of localities and the most expansive distribution for the species Stenactis annua, Robinia pseudoacacia, Solidago canadensis, Impatiens glandulifera and Fallopia japonica.</dc:description>
