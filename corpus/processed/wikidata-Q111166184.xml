  <dc:description>AbstractInvasive alien species negatively impact upon biodiversity and generate significant economic costs worldwide. Globally, amphibians have suffered considerable losses, with a key driver being predation by large invasive invertebrate and vertebrate predators. However, there is no research regarding the potential ecological impact of small invertebrate invaders. The invasive freshwater amphipodDikerogammarus villosuscan act as a top predator capable of displacing native amphipods and preying heavily upon a range of native species. Listed as one of Europe’s top 100 worst invaders,D. villosushas significantly restructured freshwater communities across western Europe and is expected to invade North America in the near future. Here we explore the ecological impact of invasiveD. villosusupon UK native and invasive amphibians (Rana temporariaandXenopus laevisrespectively) using the “Relative Impact Potential” (RIP) metric. By combining estimations ofper capitaeffects (i.e. functional response; FR) and relative field abundances, we apply the RIP metric to quantify the potential ecological impact of invasiveD. villosusupon embryonic and larval amphibian prey, compared to the native amphipodGammarus pulex. Both native and invasive amphipods consumed early-stage amphibians and exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs. However, larger body size in invasiveD. villosustranslated into a superior FR through significantly lower handling times and subsequently higher maximum feeding rates—up to seven times greater than nativeG. pulex. Higher invader abundance also drove elevated RIP scores for invasiveD. villosus, with potential impact scores predicted up to 15.4 times greater than nativeG. pulex. Overall,D. villosusis predicted to have a greater predatory impact upon amphibian populations thanG. pulex, due primarily to its larger body size and superior field abundance, potentially reducing amphibian recruitment within invaded regions.</dc:description>
