  <dc:description>&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Japanese cedar (Chrytomeria japonica D. Don) is an important plantation species in Taiwan and represents 10% of total plantation area. It was first introduced in 1910 and widely planted in the northern and central mountainous areas of Taiwan. However, a change in forest management from exotic species to native species in 1980 had resulted in few new Japanese cedar plantations being established. Most Japanese cedar plantations are now between 30 and 50 years old and reaching their rotation period. It is of interest to know whether these plantations could be viable for future carbon sequestration through the accumulations of stand carbon stocks. Twelve even-aged Japanese cedar stands along a stand age gradient from 37 to 93 years were selected in Xitou of central Taiwan. The study aims were to investigate the basic stand characteristics and biomass carbon stock in current Japanese cedar stands, and determine the relationships among stand characteristics, tree biomass carbon, and stand age.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our results indicate that existing Japanese cedar plantations are still developing and their live tree biomass carbon continues to accumulate. At stands with a stand age of 90 years, tree density, canopy height, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, and live tree biomass carbon stocks reach to nearly 430 tree ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 27 m, 48 cm, 82 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 300 Mg C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Therefore, with no harvesting, current Japanese cedar plantations provide a carbon sink by storing carbon in tree biomass.</dc:description>
