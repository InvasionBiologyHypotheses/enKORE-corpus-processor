  <dc:description>Exotic plant species impact belowground processes by influencing resource availability through enhanced microbial activity as a consequence of litter inputs. Soil communities cultured by Ageratina adenophora, a neotropical invader in Asia, retain available N that influence the growth of the invader. Invader triggers higher microbial activities through terpene-rich litter inputs to release nitrogen, which facilitates the invasion of A. adenophora. Our results provide evidence that microbial-linked nitrogen availability exert positive impact on A. adenophora biomass accumulation. Our work emphasizes the importance of soil communities-drive nitrogen availability in invasion success. Exotic plant species impact belowground processes by influencing resource availability through enhanced microbial activity as a consequence of litter inputs. We have little understanding of the impact of microbe-driven nutrient fluctuations on the biomass accumulation of invasive species. Here we attempt to answer the question on whether soil community-driven nitrogen availability influences invader biomass. We discovered that soil communities cultured by Ageratina adenophora, a neotropical invader in Asia, retain available nitrogen that influences the biomass of the invader. Through soil manipulation experiments we found that A. adenophora grows better in soil with a higher available nitrogen content. Ageratina adenophora-invaded soil had higher microbial activity and available nitrogen due to higher inputs of terpene-rich litter compared with soil not yet invaded by it. Our results provide evidence that microbe-linked nitrogen availability exerts a positive impact on A. adenophora biomass accumulation. Our work emphasizes the importance of soil community-driven nitrogen availability in invasion success.</dc:description>
