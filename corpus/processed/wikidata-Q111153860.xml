  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Mollusks are the macroinvertebrates most commonly introduced into fresh water. In invaded reservoirs, alien mollusks form a large biomass due to their large size. Climate change, water level regulation, and anthropogenic impacts on the environment lead to the drying up of water bodies and the death of littoral macroinvertebrates. To assess the impact of invasive snail mass mortality on water quality, laboratory experiments on the snail tissue decomposition were performed, the potential release of nutrients into aquatic ecosystems was calculated, and the predicted concentrations of nutrients were verified by field studies. The laboratory experiment showed quick decomposition of the common river snail Viviparus viviparus tissues with release into the environment of ammonium and total phosphorus of 2.72 ± 0.14 mg and 0.10 ± 0.02 mg, respectively, per gram of decomposing tissue. The concentrations of ammonium, nitrates, and total phosphorus at the site of snail death reached 2.70 ± 0.10, 3.13 ± 0.38 and 0.30 ± 0.02 mg/L, respectively. This indicates local contamination of the Novosibirsk reservoir littoral with decomposition products. The aquatic management, water level regulation, and control of undesirable species should take into account the likelihood of water quality decreasing as a result of macroinvertebrate mass mortality.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
