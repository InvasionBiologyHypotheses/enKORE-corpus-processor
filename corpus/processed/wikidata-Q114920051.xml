  <dc:description>A brief background of events leading to the successful implementation of the first_ASEAN-India project on marine sciences is provided. Coordinated by India and Singapore, the project,_entitled ‘Extent of transfer of alien invasive organisms in South/Southeast Asia region by_shipping’ served to develop regional cooperation and networks to address the issue of alien invasive_organisms, provide training for ASEAN scientists, as well as obtain baseline information on pest_species for port management in the light of IMO’s Ballast Water Management Convention. The project_was completed with an international workshop held in Chiangmai, Thailand where some 29_presentations were made by ASEAN and Indian scientists based on the project activities. A total of_23 original articles are included in this volume. A proposal to implement a second phase of the_project was formally submitted to the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund in 2016.</dc:description>
