  <dc:description>In this paper, the invasion of a new alien beetle species to Europe, the longhorn Xylotrechus chinensis (Chevrolat) (Cerambycidae), originating from East Asia, is revealed. It has settled in Catalonia (Spain), occupying at present an area of at least 44.1 km_, where it has been shown to severely infest (ca. 10 to 45%) and eventually kill mulberry trees in private and public grounds. The main objective of this study was to evaluate its impact and provide new significant insights into its life history, seasonality, reproductive capacity (females produce an average of 83.4 ± 9.02 eggs) and the type of damage produced to mulberries. Such damage was thoroughly described to facilitate inspection by others. At least in laboratory conditions, X. chinensis has not used common grape vines as an alternative hostplant. Both plants, mulberries and grape vines, are important in Catalonia and Spain, the former providing shade and ornament to many streets and avenues, and the latter having great economic significance in Mediterranean wine production areas. Possible control methods to hinder its spread are suggested and one local wasp, Stephanus serrator (Stephanidae), was identified as a likely parasitoid. We believe the risk of this beetle widely spreading in Europe is very real.</dc:description>
