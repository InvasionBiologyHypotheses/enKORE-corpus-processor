  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;High elevation plant populations, such as those found in sub-alpine meadows, are at the forefront of climate change and likely to experience novel interactions with migrating plants from lower elevations, including non-native species. Some of these non-native plants, particularly members of the Brassicaceae, produce secondary metabolites that have been shown to inhibit root fungi in other ecosystems. We conducted a growth experiment with plant leachates in order to evaluate the degree to which the dominant high elevation grass species, &lt;jats:italic&gt;Festuca thurberi&lt;/jats:italic&gt; would be affected by future novel interactions with the non-native mustard, &lt;jats:italic&gt;Thlaspi arvense&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, relative to a native mustard (&lt;jats:italic&gt;Noccaea fendleri&lt;/jats:italic&gt;). We assessed growth, chlorophyll content, biomass, mortality, and percent colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in different genotypes of &lt;jats:italic&gt;F. thurberi&lt;/jats:italic&gt; exposed to leachates from native and non-native mustards as well as &lt;jats:italic&gt;F. thurberi&lt;/jats:italic&gt; leachate and a deionized (DI) water control. New growth and mortality varied more by genotype than by treatment with leachate of &lt;jats:italic&gt;F. thurberi&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, &lt;jats:italic&gt;T. arvense&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, and &lt;jats:italic&gt;N. fendleri&lt;/jats:italic&gt;. Treatment, genotype, and the treatment × genotype interaction all had significant effects on chlorophyll content, with &lt;jats:italic&gt;N. fendleri&lt;/jats:italic&gt; treatments demonstrating higher relative greenness levels than control treatments. Percent of fine roots with dark septate endophytes was significantly affected by individual genotype and treatment × genotype interaction, but there were no effects of treatment, genotype, or their interaction on percent root colonization by arbuscules or vesicles. Overall, we show that performance of a dominant high-altitude grass species varies in its response to the presence of an expanding, non-native plant, which may become increasingly common due to climate change.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
