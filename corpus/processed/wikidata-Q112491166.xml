  <dc:description>A greater relative growth rate (RGR) is positively correlated with a species’ ability to deploy a larger leaf area either due to a greater total number of leaves (LN) in the canopy or due to an average size of individual leaves (LA). This study aimed to analyze and compare, (1) the temporal (i.e., daily) RGR, leaf production rate (LPR), and leaf area production rate (LAPR) changes during the early growth stages of three among the most invasive species in the world, namely, Ailanthus altissima, Phytolacca americana, and Robinia pseudoacacia. (2) the interspecific differences in the relationship between RGR, LPR, LAPR, and mean daily air temperature. Our results show that growth dynamics as a function of temperature differ between invasive alien species (IAS). While these differences are partly explained by differences due to the growth form of the investigated species, the three IAS have a different behavior to adjust RGR, LPR, and LAPR with air temperature changes even within the same growth form, and in agreement with species habitat requirements in their native range. In conclusion, the results help disentangle the relative role of RGR, LPR, and LAPR in defining non-native species growth responses to mean daily air temperature also in relation to a species’ growth form.</dc:description>
