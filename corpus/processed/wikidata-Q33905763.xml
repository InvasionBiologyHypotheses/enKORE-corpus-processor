  <dc:description>AbstractBacterial environmental and surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance was implemented from 2011–2016 in a UK Equine Referral Veterinary Hospital and identified 81 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. A cluster of MRSA SSIs occurred in early 2016 with the isolates confirmed as ST398 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which prompted retrospective analysis of all MRSA isolates obtained from the environment (n_=_62), SSIs (n_=_13) and hand plates (n_=_6) in the past five years. Sixty five of these isolates were typed to CC398 and a selection of these (n_=_38) were further characterised for resistance and virulence genes, SCCmec and spa typing. Overall, MRSA was identified in 62/540 (11.5%) of environmental samples, 6/81 of the hand-plates (7.4%) and 13/208 of the SSIs (6.3%). spa t011 was the most frequent (24/38) and Based Upon Repeat Pattern (BURP) analysis identified spa t011 as one of the two group founders of the main spa CC identified across the five years (spa CC011/3423). However, 3 singletons (t073, t786, t064) were also identified suggesting separate introductions into the hospital environment. This long-term MRSA surveillance study revealed multiple introductions of MRSA CC398 in a UK Equine Hospital, identifying an emerging zoonotic pathogen so far only sporadically recorded in the UK.</dc:description>
