  <dc:description>Invasive species are an important and growing issue of concern for land managers, and the ability to collect and visualize species coverage data is vital to the management of invasive and native species. This is particularly true of spatial data, which provides invaluable information on location, establishment rates, and spread rates necessary for managing habitats. However, current methods of collection are rarely integrated into a full management tool, making it difficult to quickly collect and visualize multiple years of data for multiple species. We created the Geospatial Meadow Management Tool (GMMT) to provide a complete framework from geospatial data collection to web visualization. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using Valley Forge National Historical Park meadow survey data. The GMMT was created through the ArcGIS suite of software, taking advantage of the modularity of multiple processes, and incorporating an online visualization dashboard that allows for quick and efficient data analysis. Using Valley Forge National Historical Park as a case study, the GMMT provides a wide range of useful species coverage data and visualizations that provide simple yet insightful ways to understand species distribution. This tool highlights the ability of a web-based visualization tool to be modified to incorporate the needs of users, providing powerful visuals for non-GIS experts. Future avenues for this work include highlighted open-data and community engagement, such as citizen science, to address the increasing threat of invasive species both on and off public lands.</dc:description>
