  <dc:description>This communication is an effort to decipher phytogeographic alterations particularly due to exotic plants associated with the teachings and disclosures of Lord Buddha. The various exotic taxa on Indian landmass in Lord Buddha’s time had an important role to play in human sustenance and civilization. The present author, therefore, analysed plant species as contained in ‘Pali Tipitaka’ in view of plant invasion in ancient period in Indian territory. It was possible to identify total 70 exotic plant species pertaining to 66 genera and 41 angiospermic families. Majority of them (47 species) are introduced for cultivation in India to sustain human life, while 19 species exhibit wildness and integral to Indian biodiversity in present time. Their native geographical regions are deciphered consulting relevant literature. They belong to both Old and New Worlds. Importance of ancient religious scriptures is brought under clearer focus from standpoint of phytogeography and plant invasion.</dc:description>
