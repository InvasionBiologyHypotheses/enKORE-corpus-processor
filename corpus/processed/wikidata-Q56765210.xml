  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Tilapia mariae (Cichlidae) is a tropical teleost, native to West African coastal drainages in the Gulf of Guinea and naturalised in the USA, Australia and possibly Russia. This paper reviews published information on the species from its native and introduced range to improve the effective management of fisheries as well as manage current infestations, reduce further spread and promote research on control measures outside its natural range. Within its natural range, the species is abundant and contributes to the local subsistence and artisanal fisheries; however, it is not extensively utilised for aquaculture. Outside its native range, it has proliferated, particularly in disturbed aquatic ecosystems. Tilapia mariae has several characteristics that make it successful in both its natural and introduced range. These include plasticity in reproductive behaviour (particularly parental care of the brood), a variety of feeding behaviours and dietary components, tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions and aggressive behaviour to other fish species. Although tilapiine species are considered to be amongst the world’s worst invasive alien species, surprisingly little information is available on potential impacts of T. mariae on native species and aquatic ecosystems outside its native range.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
