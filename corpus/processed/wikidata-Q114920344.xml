  <dc:description>Abstract
               A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the problems caused by invasive alien species (IAS) in Hungarian protected areas (PAs). Results from 144 PAs were evaluated and compared with a previous study of 21 European countries. In the European survey, the most important threats were habitat loss and fragmentation, Hungarian respondents put IAS in first place. Eradication, control and prevention were mentioned among the best strategies against invasive species in both surveys, but Hungarian PA managers emphasized the efficiency of habitat restoration and regulatory as well. Comparing the harmful animals and plants occurring in most Hungarian and European PAs, we found nearly 30% similarity. In most Hungarian PAs domestic cat (Felis catus Linnaeus, 1758) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) were indicated as most harmful species. The results of our study draw the attention to the species, which are highly invasive in Hungary, but are missing from the European PAs list, therefore may pose a potential threat to other protected areas of Europe.</dc:description>
