  <dc:description>The fact that superabundant invasive pests are also sometimes highly aggressive represents an interesting paradox. Strong intraspecific aggression should result in high intraspecific competition and limit the densities reached by exotic species. One mechanism that can allow invaders to attain high densities despite high intraspecific aggression, involves positive correlations between aggression and other behaviors such as foraging activity. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify the ecological implications of correlations between aggressiveness and foraging activity among groups of exotic signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) at low and high densities. Our results showed that high invader densities increased intraspecific aggression and per capita interactions between crayfish, but also increased foraging activity and impacts on preferred prey. As a result, exotic crayfish did not show density-dependent reductions in per capita feeding or growth rates. We suggest that the positive correlation between aggression and activity is part of an aggression syndrome whereby some individuals are generally more aggressive/active than others across situations. An aggression syndrome can couple aggressive behaviors important to population establishment of invasive species with foraging activity that enhances the ability of invaders to attain high densities and have large impacts on invaded communities.</dc:description>
