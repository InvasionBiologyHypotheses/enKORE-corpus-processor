  <dc:description>Background:Historically, baseline neutropenia and lack of neutrophil recovery have been associated with poor outcomes in invasive aspergillosis (IA). It is unclear how treatment with the new Aspergillus-active triazoles isavuconazole and voriconazole affects outcomes in neutropenic patients with IA. Methods:A post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 SECURE trial assessed patients with neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt;0.5 × 109/L for &gt;10 days at baseline) with IA (proven/probable) who had received either isavuconazole or voriconazole. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality (ACM) through day 42. ACM in patients with resolved versus unresolved neutropenia at day 7 and overall success at end of treatment (EOT) were also assessed. Results:One hundred and forty-two patients with neutropenia and IA were included (isavuconazole n = 78, voriconazole n = 64). ACM through day 42 (primary endpoint), day 7 and EOT were higher for patients with unresolved versus resolved neutropenia at each timepoint (day 42, unresolved: 45.0% isavuconazole, 45.2% voriconazole; resolved: 5.0% isavuconazole, 5.9% voriconazole; day 7, unresolved: 31.0% isavuconazole, 29.8% voriconazole; resolved: 5.0% isavuconazole, 5.9% voriconazole; EOT, unresolved: 48.6% isavuconazole, 36.4% voriconazole; resolved: 5.0% isavuconazole, 14.3% voriconazole). ACM was significantly higher for isavuconazole-treated patients with unresolved versus resolved neutropenia (day 7, P = 0.031; day 42, P &lt; 0.001; EOT, P &lt; 0.001). In voriconazole-treated patients, ACM was significantly higher among patients with unresolved versus resolved neutropenia at day 42 (P = 0.002) and numerically higher at day 7 and EOT (P &gt; 0.05 for both). Conclusions:Isavuconazole had comparable efficacy and safety to voriconazole in neutropenic patients with IA. Resolution of neutropenia was associated with improved outcomes.</dc:description>
