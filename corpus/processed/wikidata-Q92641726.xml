  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Dendroctonus valens, an invasive bark beetle, has caused severe damage to Chinese forests. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota and its fundamental role in host fitness. Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods have been applied in analyzing beetlesâ€™ gut microbiota. The former method cannot present a whole picture of the community, and the latter mostly generates short read lengths that cannot be assigned to species. Here, the PacBio sequencing system was utilized to capture full-length 16S rRNA sequences in D. valens gut throughout its ontogeny. A total of eight phyla, 55 families, 102 genera, and 253 species were identified. Bacterial communities in colonized beetles have the greatest richness but the lowest evenness in all life stages, which is different from those in young larvae. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia liquefaciens possess high abundance throughout its ontogeny and may serve as members of the core bacteriome. A phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis predicted that gut microbiota in larvae are rich in genes involved in carbohydrate, energy metabolism. Gut microbiota in both larvae and colonized beetles are rich in xenobiotics and terpenoids biodegradation, which are decreased in dispersal beetles. Considering that the results are based mainly on the analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt prediction, further confirmation is needed to improve the knowledge of the gut microbiota in D. valens and help to resolve taxonomic uncertainty at the species level.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
