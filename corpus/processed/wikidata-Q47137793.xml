  <dc:description>While there is considerable interest in, and good evidence for, the role that parasites play in biological invasions, the potential parallel effects of species introduction on parasite dynamics have clearly received less attention. Indeed, much effort has been focused on how parasites can facilitate or limit invasions, and positively or negatively impact native host species and recipient communities. Contrastingly, the potential consequences of biological invasions for the diversity and dynamics of both native and introduced parasites have been and are still mainly overlooked, although successful invasion by non-native host species may have large, contrasting and unpredictable effects on parasites. This review looks at the links between biological invasions and pathogens, and particularly at crustacean invasions in aquatic ecosystems and their potential effects on native and invasive parasites, and discusses what often remains unknown even from well-documented systems. Aquatic crustaceans are hosts to many parasites and are often invasive. Published studies show that crustacean invasion can have highly contrasting effects on parasite dynamics, even when invasive host and parasite species are phylogenetically close to their native counterparts. These effects seem to be dependent on multiple factors such as host suitability, parasite life-cycle or host-specific resistance to parasitic manipulation. Furthermore, introduced hosts can have drastically contrasting effects on parasite standing crop and transmission, two parameters that should be independently assessed before drawing any conclusion on the potential effects of novel hosts on parasites and the key processes influencing disease dynamics following biological invasions. I conclude by calling for greater recognition of biological invasions' effects on parasite dynamics, more parasite-focused studies and suggest some potential ways to assess these effects.</dc:description>
