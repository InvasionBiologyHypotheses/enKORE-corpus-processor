  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;We studied the ecological niche relations of native stream fish and an alien invader, brook trout (&lt;jats:italic&gt;Salvelinus fontinalis&lt;/jats:italic&gt;), to examine if brook trout had located an underused environmental niche in our boreal study system. In both study years (1994 versus 2004), we found brook trout to have the most marginal niche position of all the fish species examined. The most important environmental variable affecting the distribution of brook trout was pH, with acid headwater sites being dominated by this species. Brown trout, in contrast, had relatively nonmarginal niche, occurring in average conditions across the sampled sites. Other fish species had niche positions between the two salmonids. Our results show that fish invasions may be strongly facilitated by the presence of suboptimally occupied environmental niche space in the recipient river system.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
