  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Heather (Calluna vulgaris) and broom (Cytisus scoparius), originally from Europe, are the main invasive plants on New Zealand’s North Island Central Plateau, where they threaten native flora and fauna. Given the strong link between arthropod communities and plants, we explored the impact of these invasive weeds on the diversity and composition of associated arthropod assemblages in this area. The arthropods in heather-invaded areas, broom-invaded areas, and areas dominated by the native species mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and Dracohyllum (Dracophyllum subulatum) were collected and identified to order. During summer and autumn, arthropods were collected using beating trays, flight intercept traps and pitfall traps. Diversity indices (Richness, Shannon’s index and Simpson’s index) were calculated at the order level, and permutational multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA) was used to explore differences in order-level community composition. Our results show a significant variation in community composition for all trapping methods in both seasons, whereas invasive plants did not profoundly impact arthropod order richness. The presence of broom increased arthropod abundance, while heather was linked to a reduction. Under all possible plant pairings between heather, broom, mānuka, and Dracophylum, the impact of neighbouring plant identity on arthropod community composition was further explored for the samples collected using beating trays. The results suggest that during plant invasion, arthropod communities are affected by neighbouring plant identity and that impacts vary between arthropod sampling methods and seasons.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
