  <dc:description>Ornamental aquaculture is known to be one of the main sources of non-native species and Indonesia has been identified as one of the leading suppliers of these organisms worldwide. Released or escaped ornamental aquatic animals can establish new populations and become invasive. On the other hand, some invasive species can be also endangered in their native range, which is called the “Biodiversity Conservation Paradox”. This is true forArapaima gigas, one of the popular ornamental creatures and the largest bony fish of all, which is threatened in its native range in parts of Amazonia and which has been found to occur in various localities in Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. Based on climate matching we found the vast majority of Indonesian territory to be suitable for this species establishment. Keeping in mind the size and predatory behaviour ofA.gigas, we discussed possible consequences of its spread and impacts on native biota in Indonesia.</dc:description>
