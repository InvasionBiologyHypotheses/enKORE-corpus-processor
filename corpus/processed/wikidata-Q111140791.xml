  <dc:description>Background:Many alien plant species, such asTithonia diversifolia, T. rotundifoliaandT. tubaeformis, have been introduced to areas outside of their natural distribution range to provide benefits, but have subsequently become invasive, threatening biodiversity and agricultural productivity.Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine the current distribution and dates of introduction of invasiveTithoniaspecies in eastern and southern Africa and to document the effects ofT. diversifoliaon rural livelihoods in Zambia.Method:Roadside surveys, and other sources of information, were used to determine the distribution of invasiveTithoniaspecies in eastern and southern Africa. Household interviews were conducted to gauge perceptions and understand the impacts ofT. diversifoliaon local livelihoods in Zambiaâ€™s Copperbelt province.Results:Tithonia diversifoliais widespread in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Malawi and parts of Zambia but less so in Zimbabwe.Tithonia rotundifoliawas comparatively uncommon in eastern Africa but common in some southern African countries, whileT. tubaeformiswas invasive in Swaziland, South Africa, Zambia and possibly also Zimbabwe. According to the majority of respondents in Zambia,T. diversifoliahas negative impacts on native vegetation, mobility or access, water availability, crop yields and animal health.Conclusion:InvasiveTithoniaspecies are widespread and spreading throughout much of Africa. Livelihood and biodiversity costs have not been considered by those actively promoting the use and further dissemination ofT. diversifolia. We therefore recommend that detailed costbenefit studies should be undertaken to support informed decisions on the future management of these species.</dc:description>
