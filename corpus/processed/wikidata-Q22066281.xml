  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Since the Age of Exploration began, there has been a drastic
 breaching of biogeographic barriers that previously had isolated the
 continental biotas for millions of years. We explore the nature of
 these recent biotic exchanges and their consequences on evolutionary
 processes. The direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the
 biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of
 trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases.
 There are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary
 pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement,
 hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction.
 Invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with
 natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment.
 Flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the
 success of invaders in their new environment.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
