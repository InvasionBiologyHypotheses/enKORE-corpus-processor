  <dc:description>[Background] Tribolium destructor is a significant pest in grain and bean storage. Its adult and larva can feed on grains,beans and their processed products,such as oats,flour,dried fruit and otherstored foods. During feeding a strong smell is released and obvious damage can be seen. [Method] In accordance with the guidelines for pest risk analysis of the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) of FAO,an integrated multi-index evaluation system was performed in China. It examined five aspects of invasion risk: possibility of introduction,establishment,dispersal,harmful influence,and risk management. [Result] The risk assessment value for T. destructor in China was 2. 22. [Conclusion and significance] T. destructor belongs to high risk of harmful pests and it is essential to implement the corresponding risk management and quarantine in the entry port of China. These results provide reference for carrying out quarantine and control of T. destructor.</dc:description>
