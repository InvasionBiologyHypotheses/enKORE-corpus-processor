  <dc:description>&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;The Argentine ant, &lt;jats:italic&gt;Linepithema humile&lt;/jats:italic&gt; Mayr, has spread to almost all continents. In each introduced region, &lt;jats:italic&gt;L. humile&lt;/jats:italic&gt; often forms a single large colony (supercolony), the members of which share the haplotype “LH1”, despite the presence of other supercolonies with different genetic structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the successful invasion of LH1 ants are unclear. Here, we examined whether diet breadth differs between more successful (LH1) and less successful (LH2, LH3, LH4) &lt;jats:italic&gt;L. humile&lt;/jats:italic&gt; supercolonies in Japan to better understand the processes responsible for invasion success. The standard ellipse areas (SEAs) of &lt;jats:italic&gt;δ&lt;/jats:italic&gt;&lt;jats:sup&gt;13&lt;/jats:sup&gt;C and &lt;jats:italic&gt;δ&lt;/jats:italic&gt;&lt;jats:sup&gt;15&lt;/jats:sup&gt;N and their ranges (CR and NR) were used as diet breadth indices. The SEAs of LH1 were much larger than those of the less successful supercolonies despite no differences in the baseline SEAs of arthropods within the supercolony habitats, indicating that the invasion success of a supercolony is associated with its diet breadth. Furthermore, LH1 had a broader CR than the other supercolonies, suggesting that which might be derived from superior resource exploitation ability. Our study highlights the importance of focusing on intraspecific differences in diet breadth among supercolonies when assessing organisms that can potentially invade and become dominant in new habitats.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
