  <dc:description>Since 2016, the invasive halophyte Spartina anglica has been colonizing mudflats along the western coast of South Korea. In order to minimize costs on S. anglica expansion management and waste-treatment of collected biomass, the potential application of the collected biomass of S. anglica was investigated. Ethanolic extracts and subfractions thereof (hexanes, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, 1-butanol, and water-soluble) of the aerial and belowground parts of S. anglica showed free radical-scavenging [2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,2â€™-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)], tyrosinase inhibitory, and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities. An ethyl acetate fraction derived from aerial parts (EA-a) showed the most potent radical-scavenging and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities, whereas tyrosinase inhibition was mainly observed in the methylene chloride soluble fractions (MC-bg) and other lipophilic fractions (ethyl acetate and hexanes layers) obtained from belowground parts. The major EA-a compound isolated and identified was 1,3-di-O-trans-feruloyl quinic acid (1) based on spectroscopic analysis, whereas the two major MC-bg compounds were identified as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (3). Compounds 1 and 3 scavenged both DPPH and ABTS radicals, whereas 1 and 2 inhibited pancreatic lipase activity. These results indicate that extracts and fractions of S. anglica have antioxidant, anti-obesity, and whitening properties with potential pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, and functional food applications.</dc:description>
