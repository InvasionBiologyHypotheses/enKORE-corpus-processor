  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;The assessment of the impacts of the expansion of the invasive species on taxonomic diversity, the abundance and dominance of groups of algae, the presence and/or absence of species of ecological interest that may or may not be indicative of water quality well mentioned, through the installation of a 20 × 20 cm quadrat representing the minimum area. The observation stations were visited monthly, during a repetitive three-year cycle, during the spring, summer and autumn seasons, periods of maximum growth and development of the algal flora and the results suggest the following facts. The invasive alga &lt;jats:italic&gt;Caulerpa cylindracea&lt;/jats:italic&gt; Sonder, 1845 tends to colonise disturbed ecosystems reflecting a reduction in native algal diversity; in fact, we note a drastic impoverishment of the invaded algal community, represented by a limited number of Macrophyte algae accompanying the invasive taxon in phytosociological surveys and a Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H’) and Equitability reduced by 4.49 and 0.77 n the heavily affected station. The number of macroalgal species accompanying the invasive species has dropped by 52% in Salamandre. In addition, the multidimensional analysis, represented by the Hierarchical Ascendant Clustering applied to this case, confirms our results.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
