  <dc:description>Purpose of reviewDiagnosis during early stages of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and targeted antifungal treatment has the potential to improve survival significantly. Despite advances in the diagnostic arsenal, invasive mold infections remain difficult to diagnose-especially at early stages before typical radiological signs develop. Varying availability and time-to-results are important limitations of current approved biomarkers and molecular assays for diagnosis of IA. Here, we will give an update on the Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device (LFD) test. We further review promising findings on feasibility of point-of-care (POC) detection of urinary excreted fungal galactomannan-like antigens.Recent findingsPOC LFD assays for detection of Aspergillus antigens are currently in development. The Aspergillus-specific LFD test, which is based on the JF5 antibody (Ab), detects an extracellular glycoprotein antigen secreted during active growth of Aspergillus spp. The test has shown promising results in various studies. In addition, a monoclonal Ab476-based LFD for POC detection of urinary excreted fungal galactomannan-like antigens has been developed but needs further validation.SummaryImportant advances have been made in the development of LFD assays for IA. Most promising is the Aspergillus-specific LFD test; commercial availability is still pending, however. The search for reliable POC tests for other molds, including mucorales, continues.</dc:description>
