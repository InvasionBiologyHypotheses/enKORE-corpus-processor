  <dc:description>Abstract
          Tone reservation (TR) is one of the attractive techniques to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. As conventional TR technique requires exhaustive searching over all the combinations of the given peak reduction tone (PRT) sets, it results in computational complexity that increases exponentially with the number of the subcarriers. In this paper, we aim to obtain a desirable PAPR reduction with low computational complexity. Since the process of searching the optimal PRT set can be categorized as combinatorial optimization with some variables and constraints, we propose a novel scheme, which is based on a nonlinear optimization approach named as invasive weed optimization method, to search the optimal combination of PRT set with low complexity. To validate the analytical results, extensive simulations have been conducted, showing that the proposed schemes can achieve significant reduction in computational complexity while keeping good PAPR reduction. As results of simulations, the proposed scheme shows almost the same PAPR reduction performance as compared with the genetic algorithm-based TR method which has been known to have the best performance and obtains near-optimal PRT sets.</dc:description>
