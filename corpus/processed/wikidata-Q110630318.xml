  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt; Species of Psithyrus (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are obligate social parasites of bumblebees. They range from monospecificity to species which have many Bombus hosts. Much of the reported variation in host–parasite behaviour which occurs during attempted nest usurpations may be explained in the context of host specificity. Psithyrus ashtoni is a relatively specialized bumblebee social parasite. The ability of P. ashtoni females to successfully enter laboratory colonies of Bombus affinis and Bombus terricola was tested. Female Psithyrus were introduced into more than 100 host colonies containing 0–58 workers. Parasites and host queens never fought, but in both hosts, invasion success decreased with increasing worker numbers. The passive nest usurpation behaviour of P. ashtoni differs from that of other, nonspecialized species of Psithyrus, which may kill or displace the host queen, and from that of completely specialized parasites, which may cohabit with both host queens and host workers. Host specialization may allow Psithyrus females to evolve behavioural and physiological features which minimize host defenses. Thus, while the number of available host species is limited, there is an increased probability of successful usurpation in nests of the appropriate host. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
