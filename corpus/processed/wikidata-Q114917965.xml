  <dc:description>In Portugal, some species are now considered invasive by law and have proliferated in recent years. Among these, Acacia dealbata stands out. This work investigated the behavior of this species, in order to characterize and evaluate its potential as raw material for biomass pellets production, while controlling its proliferation. It was found that A. dealbata has a large capacity for raw material supply, as cutting 2 ha resulted in about 140 tons of biomass. Thus, the attribution of a market value for this material could result in a reduction in the area occupied by the invasive species, once the demand for it increases, causing a pressure over the resource. This pressure on the species must be duly followed by other control measures, such as reducing the population and mitigating its proliferation. Laboratory tests have shown that both the raw material and the finished product are similar to those obtained with other species normally used for biomass pellet production, such as Pinus pinaster and Eucalyptus globulus. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a high potential for this species in the production of biomass pellets for energy, and that this may be an important contribution to controlling the proliferation of this invasive species.</dc:description>
