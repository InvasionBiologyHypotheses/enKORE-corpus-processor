  <dc:description>Background: KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) is an endangered subtropical_grassland type, of which a large proportion occurs within the eThekwini Municipal Area_(EMA).Objectives: Examining the flora of KZNSS will allow a more fundamental understanding of_the potential variability across remnant patches of this vegetation type, increasing the ability_to accurately delimit KZNSS from adjacent similar vegetation types.Method: Floristic data were collected using quadrats and transects for three recognised KZNSS_sites (Giba Gorge Environmental Precinct (GGEP), Inanda Mountain (IM) and Springside_Nature Reserve (SSNR)), all within the EMA. Alpha diversity (Shannon’s exponential and_Simpson’s inverse indices) and beta diversity measures were calculated and compared across_all sites. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis using_the Jaccard index and a non-parametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination were_used to assess similarity amongst quadrats across the three sites.Results: One hundred and thirty-one plant species were found to occur in GGEP, 95 in IM and_121 in SSNR. However, of the total 193 species found to occur collectively (i.e. quadrat and_transect data combined) across the three sites, only 50 species were common to all these sites._The results of the alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed significant floristic variability_both within and across the KZNSS sites sampled, with Shannon’s exponential index being_highest in SSNR, followed by GGEP and lowest in IM. The lack of controlled access and_unregulated burning regimes appear to have clearly affected the flora at the IM site in terms of_species richness and increased evenness, as well as the relatively greater presence of introduced_alien species and lower abundances of taxa of conservation concern. The pristine GGEP site had_the highest number of species in total, with species being less evenly spread across the site, as_well as the highest number of taxa conservation and low abundances of alien species. The_main separations in the ordination results can be attributed to quadrat sampling performed_pre- and post-burn.Conclusion: The floristic distinction of IM from GGEP and SSNR is attributed here to the_intermediate disturbance effect of fire in grasslands which can lead to species loss if burning is_too frequent. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the delimitation,_classification and management of KZNSS</dc:description>
