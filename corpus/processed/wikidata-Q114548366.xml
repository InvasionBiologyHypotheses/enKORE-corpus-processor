  <dc:description>The paper gives an overview of non-native and invasive tree species, and
   offers the basic data about their current presence in European forests. It
   deals with definitions and classifications and explains how these species
   can affect new environment with the emphasis on local biodiversity loss. The
   process of invasion is also explained, emphasizing that there is a lag phase
   in which a species does not reveal its invasiveness, which can last even a
   few centuries (for certain species). That is why it is important to monitor
   non-native species and prevent their further establishment. Invasive species
   are less likely to develop in habitats with intense inter-species
   competition over a long period of time, in undisturbed areas with high
   biodiversity, but also in areas with the lack of nutrients, light and water
   or in areas where these resources are being heavily exploited by local plant
   communities.</dc:description>
