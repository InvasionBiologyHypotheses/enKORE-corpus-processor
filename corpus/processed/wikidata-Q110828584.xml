  <dc:description>&lt;jats:p&gt;Alien invasive vegetation threatens the functioning and existence of natural ecosystems in South Africa because many of these plants have no predators or competitors, allowing them to dominate the ecosystem which they inhabit. The rapid proliferation of this alien vegetation, ascribed to the increase in afforestation and changes in land use, has had significant adverse impacts on water resources, biodiversity and the stability as well as integrity of these ecosystems. Although eradicating alien invasive vegetation gives rise to a number of different benefits, this process entails enormous costs. Consequently, in order to establish the economic viability of alien plant eradication it is essential to analyse these costs as well as the benefits associated with eradication.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</dc:description>
